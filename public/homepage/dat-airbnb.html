                    <p>Founded in 2008, Airbnb has developed into a mature hospitality sharing economy company, providing short-term stays in homes around the world. With over 2 million listings in over 190 countries, Airbnb’s host base is maturing, with popular homes in every major city, validated by numerous 5-star ratings and positive reviews.</p>

                    <p>With a developed host base, the Airbnb host community is facing saturation. The platform can only list a limited number of listings in each geographical area, and new hosts are finding it hard to differentiate themselves from experienced hosts. This would restrict growth of Airbnb host base, which would in turn constrain Airbnb’s overall growth.</p>

                    <p>With limited listing space on its platform, Airbnb must develop ways to give new hosts a good chance of building up a track record. Up against mature listings with validated ratings and reviews, promising new hosts need a differentiating factor to signal their quality.</p>

                    <p>That being said, how would Airbnb distinguish between the mediocre entrants from the promising ones? Would location be a factor? It would be useful if the platform could somehow discern between the good from the bad entrants. Otherwise, it would be placing possibly mediocre listings ahead of good and experienced listings, which would otherwise give users a better experience.</p>

                    <p>This brings about the basis of our project. Applying data science techniques to Airbnb’s data, we will see if we can predict the popularity of listings.</p>

With the tech industry fuelling housing prices and rentals, Airbnb has grown into a way which homeowners list their homes or rooms for short-term stays in order to parlay their housing costs. The Airbnb landscape is comparatively developed in SF, which makes it a suitable city to study as a mature listings community.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">From the structured description data, we were able to apply Naive Bayes to find something interesting. With a ngrams of n=2, we were able to observe that the predictive ability of the vectorised vocabulary is surprisingly high, of up to 70% and above. With the text data, we can predict with reasonable accuracy whether a listing would be popular.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Interesting follow up work could be done to understand the description drafting process. For instance, particular words could contribute to popularity, making it a copywriting problem; the text could otherwise contain nouns and verbs that reflect the inherent popularity of the listings. These could all possibly translate into prompts in the form filling process to support Airbnb hosts' success.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">In the meantime, if we could take the description data and run naïve bayes through it, we could have a reasonably good predictor of popularity.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">To apply the insights to the actual Airbnb platform, we could possibly use the description field as a predictor of the popularity of new listings. For listings that have a good chance of becoming a popular listing, the Airbnb platform should promote them as a "Fresh!" listing, in place of rating stars and review counts to give them higher odds of being considered by an Airbnb user.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Airbnb could display a caution when an Airbnb host attempts to overprice a listing. This will help hosts better price their listings to give themselves the best chance for popularity.</p>

                    <h4 class="featurette-heading text-left">Conclusion</h4>

                    <p class="text-left">In the past 5 years, the growth of Airbnb has been rapid. Going forward, there will be a need to prempt any constraints to scaling further, and besides making regulatory inroads, the continued growth of the Airbnb host community will be key. As the host community matures over the coming years, there will be a need to implement mechanisms for new and promising hosts to have good odds of building up a great track record. Applying data science techniques to publicly available data, we are able to suggest some small steps to do so.</p>
