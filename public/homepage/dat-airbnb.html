                    <h4 class="media-heading">Background</h4>
                    <p>Founded in 2008, Airbnb has developed into a mature hospitality sharing economy company, providing short-term stays in homes around the world. With over 2 million listings in over 190 countries, Airbnb’s host base is maturing, with popular homes in every major city, validated by numerous 5-star ratings and positive reviews.</p>

                    <p>With a developed host base, the Airbnb host community is facing saturation. The platform can only list a limited number of listings in each geographical area, and new hosts are finding it hard to differentiate themselves from experienced hosts. This would restrict growth of Airbnb host base, which would in turn constrain Airbnb’s overall growth.</p>

                    <p>With limited listing space on its platform, Airbnb must develop ways to give new hosts a good chance of building up a track record. Up against mature listings with validated ratings and reviews, promising new hosts need a differentiating factor to signal their quality.</p>

                    <p>That being said, how would Airbnb distinguish between the mediocre entrants from the promising ones? Would location be a factor? It would be useful if the platform could somehow discern between the good from the bad entrants. Otherwise, it would be placing possibly mediocre listings ahead of good and experienced listings, which would otherwise give users a better experience.</p>

                    <p>This brings about the basis of our project. Applying data science techniques to Airbnb’s data, we will see if we can predict the popularity of listings.</p>

                    <p>A wealth of home listing data is available on the Airbnb platform. With this data, we will apply a range of data science techniques to see if we are able to develop accurate predictions of whether a listing is popular.</p>

                    <p>Should we find that we can predict popularity with reasonable accuracy, we will suggest a feature on the Airbnb platform to boost promising new listings.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to <em><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/">Murray Cox</a></em>, there is extensive Airbnb data available online. From the numerous data fields, we will focus on 4 areas:</p>

                    <p><strong>a) Listings attributes</strong> - Fields that present the various attributes of the listing, including location, home type, price, amenities, capacity, costs, etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>b) Host attributes</strong> - Detailed information on the quality and behavior of the Airbnb host.</p>

                    <p><strong>c) Text descriptions</strong> - Extensive text data describing details of the home, neighbourhood, means of transport, etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>d) Ratings and reviews</strong> - Review scores covering various aspects of the listing, such accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value.</p>

                    <p>SF is the home city of Airbnb, and is currently one of the most fascinating real estate markets in the world. With the tech industry fuelling housing prices and rentals, Airbnb has grown into a way which homeowners list their homes or rooms for short-term stays in order to parlay their housing costs. The Airbnb landscape is comparatively developed in SF, which makes it a suitable city to study as a mature listings community.</p>

                    <p>Using the latitude and longitude fields, we are able to geographically plot the listings and observe the distribution of listings in San Francisco. In general, the listings are concentrated in the north-east region of the city, with an outward radial dispersion towards the west and southward areas. Clustering the listings using DBSCAN, we are able to observe that there is a extended saturated region in the central to north-eastern part of SF. with the city fringes as perpheral clusters.</p>

                    <p>Charting a density scatterplot by price vs. popularity, we observe that listings tend towards the $50 to $150 per bed range. This is interesting, as it suggests that many Airbnb listings are offered as lower-end accomodation, and compete on a different price point as compared to hotels.</p>

                    <p>Fitting the price data to a logistic regression showed that if a listing was priced beyond a certain point, an Airbnb listing was bound to be unpopular. At the same time, high-priced listings might have intended to position themselves as high-margin and low-volume.</p>

                    <p>Applying decision trees, we found that the RMSE is minimised when max depth was 4, and that rating, price, and host were the most important factors in determining popularity.</p>

                    <p>From this, we observed that the main quantitative discriminant of popularity for a new listing might just be price. If it falls within a particular band, it has the chance of becoming popular. Hence, there could be potential to recommend a price band for hosts.</p>

                    <h4 class="featurette-heading">The Text May Tell Us Something</h4>

                    <p>From the structured description data, we were able to apply Naive Bayes to find something interesting. With a ngrams of n=2, we were able to observe that the predictive ability of the vectorised vocabulary is surprisingly high, of up to 70% and above. With the text data, we can predict with reasonable accuracy whether a listing would be popular.</p>

                    <p>Interesting follow up work could be done to understand the description drafting process. For instance, particular words could contribute to popularity, making it a copywriting problem; the text could otherwise contain nouns and verbs that reflect the inherent popularity of the listings. These could all possibly translate into prompts in the form filling process to support Airbnb hosts' success.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime, if we could take the description data and run naïve bayes through it, we could have a reasonably good predictor of popularity.</p>

                    <p>To apply the insights to the actual Airbnb platform, we could possibly use the description field as a predictor of the popularity of new listings. For listings that have a good chance of becoming a popular listing, the Airbnb platform should promote them as a "Fresh!" listing, in place of rating stars and review counts to give them higher odds of being considered by an Airbnb user.</p>

                    <p>Airbnb could display a caution when an Airbnb host attempts to overprice a listing. This will help hosts better price their listings to give themselves the best chance for popularity.</p>

                    <h4 class="featurette-heading text-left">Conclusion</h4>

                    <p class="text-left">In the past 5 years, the growth of Airbnb has been rapid. Going forward, there will be a need to prempt any constraints to scaling further, and besides making regulatory inroads, the continued growth of the Airbnb host community will be key. As the host community matures over the coming years, there will be a need to implement mechanisms for new and promising hosts to have good odds of building up a great track record. Applying data science techniques to publicly available data, we are able to suggest some small steps to do so.</p>
